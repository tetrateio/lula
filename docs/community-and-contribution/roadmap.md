# Roadmap
## 2024 Annual

### Q1 - Foundations & Discovery:

* Release: an initial version of Lula released to enable teams to begin development of validations. Establish process for future releases.
* CI/CD: Establish supported workflows for CI/CD. Structure (Lint) → Assess (validate) → Compare (evaluate)
* Validation Discovery: Create component definition artifacts for use on a variety of apps

### Q2 Artifacts & Provenance:

* Artifact Generation: Enable shifting context between OSCAL model artifacts where available to accelerate production of authorization artifacts. Provide reproducible process for component-definition and assessment-results.
* Provenance: Continue to iterate on improving the provenance of artifacts that Lula can process/produce.
* Document: Build and improve documentation to support tool-use with other conceptual patterns required for secure systems.

### Q3 Configuration & Coverage:

* Configuration & Templating: Enhance artifacts with optionality to template variables into OSCAL & Validations dynamically. Allowing the use of build-time and run-time templating. 
* OSCAL Model Coverage: Increase support of processable OSCAL models to include profile and system-security-plan
* Quality of Life: User Experience improvements to operating with OSCAL and Lula validations

### Q4 Data Collection:

* OSCAL Model Coverage: Increase support of processable OSCAL models to include assessment-plan and plan-of-actions-and-milestones (POAM).
* API Domain: Mature the API Domain into a more extensible option for validations.
* Data Collection: Increase domain data collection methods by 1 to enable greater compliance mapping capabilities 

## 2025 Annual (WIP)

### Q1 - Benchmarks

* Benchmark: Provide component definition artifacts for various benchmarks/best-practices (CIS etc)
