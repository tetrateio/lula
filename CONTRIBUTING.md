## Code of Conduct

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a respectful and collaborative environment.

## Getting Started

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula/](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula/)
- **Go Binaries**: [https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula/releases](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula/releases)
- **Required Go version**: `>=1.22.0`

### Setup

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/lula.git`.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create an Issue**: For significant changes, please create an issue first, describing the problem or feature proposal. Trivial fixes do not require an issue.
2. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your changes and commit them. All commits must be signed. For help follow this [guide.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
3. **Run Tests**: Ensure that your changes pass all tests by running `go test` for each required test.
4. **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
5. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the lula repository. Please make sure that your PR passes all CI checks.

### Commit Message

We use conventional commit messages [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

- `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  patch.
- `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
- `feat!:`,  or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change
  (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a SemVer major.

### Pull Request Title

PR titles should also follow this pattern and are linted using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/). The PR title will determine the version bump. When a PR is merged (squashed) release-please will kick off a release PR. When that release PR is approved and merged, release-please will create a draft release. Once that draft release is published go-releaser with build and publish the assets, including creating a release in our Homebrew tap repository: [https://github.com/defenseunicorns/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/homebrew-tap)

- Pre-v1.0.0 release-please is configured to bump minors on breaking changes and patches otherwise. per [release-please-config](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula/blob/main/release-please-config.json)

### PR Requirements

- PRs must be against the `main` branch.
- PRs must pass CI checks.
- All commits must be signed.
- PRs should have a related issue, except for trivial fixes.
- Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it.
- Update the code comments, documentation, and examples: whatever is affected by your contribution.

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Automated tests will begin based on the paths you have edited in your Pull Request. 
⚠️ NOTE: If you are an external third-party contributor, the pipelines won't run until a [CODEOWNER](CODEOWNERS) approves the pipeline run.

The exception to the automated tests are fuzzing tests, which run nightly.

### Run Tests Locally

- Run E2E tests: `make test`

### Test a Local Development Version

1. Run `make build` and wait for completion.
2. Change to the lula directory: `cd bin/lula`.
3. You can now run any of the `lula` commands.

## Documentation

The decision for processes and docs on how-to can be found in `adr/` or in `docs/`.

### Architecture Design Records (ADR)

We've chosen to use ADRs to document architecturally significant decisions. We primarily use the guidance found in [this article by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) with a couple of tweaks:

- The criteria for when an ADR is needed is undefined. The team will decide when the team needs an ADR.
- We will use the tool [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to make it easier on us to create and maintain ADRs.
- We will keep ADRs in the repository under `adr/NNNN-name-of-adr.md`. `adr-tools` is configured with a dotfile to automatically use this directory and format.

### How to use `adr-tools`

```bash
# Create a new ADR titled "Use Bisquick for all waffle making"
adr new Use Bisquick for all waffle making

# Create a new ADR that supersedes a previous one. Let's say, for example, that the previous ADR about Bisquick was ADR number 9.
adr new -s 9 Use scratch ingredients for all waffle making

# Create a new ADR that amends a previous one. Let's say the previous one was ADR number 15
adr new -l "15:Amends:Amended by" Use store-bought butter for all waffle making

# Get full help docs. There are all sorts of other helpful commands that help manage the decision log.
adr help
```
